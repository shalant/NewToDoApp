### In Development

### How to run
#### run this from your terminal: "git clone https://github.com/shalant/NewToDoApp.git", open the folder in file explorer, and click on the NewToDoApp.sln. It should open Visual Studio. In appsettings.json, you will need to add a correct connection string that works with your own DB. In top navigation, click tools => Nuget Package Manager => Package Manager Console. This will open a terminal where you need to run 2 commands: "add-migration Initial" and then "update-database". Then just click play...

### Bugs
#### For some reason, the first paint is messed up. I have to refresh to see data. WEIRD!
